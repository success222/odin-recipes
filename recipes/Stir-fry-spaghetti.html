            <p><li>Dice/chop the carrot, onion, red bell pepper, green bell pepper,
                ginger and garlic. Cut or dice them on a flat surface such that 
                each of them is separate (do not mix them).</li></p>
            <p><li>Put the spaghetti in a pot and boil. Add a spoonful of oil to
                 it and cook it for 10-15 minutes or cook until it is about 
                 70-80% done (do not let it soften too much). Bring it down
                 from the fire or cooker and drain it.</li></p>
            <p><li>Put 3 spoonfuls of oil in your frying pan and add the diced onions
                and carrot. cook this for about 2 to 3 minutes under medium heat.
                Then add the diced green and red bell pepper. Allow it to cook for
                another 3 to 4 minutes after which you will add the diced ginger and 
                garlic, salt, seasoning cubes, curry powder amd thyme (add the seasoning
                cubes and salt accordint to taste).</li></p>
             <p>If you want to add stir-fried chicken. you should stir fry the chicken
                first, separately. Bring the stir-fried veggies down and put another
                frying pan on the cooker, put 3 to 4 spoonfuls of oil and add the 
                chicken to be fried. Drain the chicken before it for about 3 to 4
                minutes. Then add it to the stir-fried veggies and put it back on the
                cooker before proceeding to the next step.</p>
            <p><li>Add the parboiled pasta to the stir-fried veggies and cook for about
                    5 minutes and stir once in a while as you cook. Your stir fry
                    spaghetti is ready!</li></p>
