        <h3>Steps!</h3>
        <ol>
            <p><li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F(175 degrees C). Line two baking
                    sheets with parchment paper.</li></p>
            <p><li>Mix together peanut butter, 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons brown
                    sugar, egg, baking soda, vanilla, salt and nutmeg until combined.
                    Mix in mini chocolate M&Ms</li></p>
            <p><li>Scoop out 1 1/2 tablespoon sized balls of dough and place 1 inch
                    apart on the baking sheets. Flatten dough balls to about 1/2 inch
                    thickness.</li></p>
            <p><li>Bake in the preheated oven until tops of cookies begin to slightly
                    crack, about 10 minutes. Allow cookies to cool 10 minutes on baking
                    sheets before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li></p>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong>A natural and unsweetened peanut butter was used for thickness
                    recipe. Depending on the kind of peanut butter you use, you may need to 
                    adjust the amount of brown sugar and salt to better suit your tastes.</p>
