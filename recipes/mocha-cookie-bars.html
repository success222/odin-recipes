        <h3>Yummy Mocha Cookie Bars</h3>
        <p>These chocolaty cookie bars are somewhat of a cross between a brownie
            and a cookie, with a flavor reminiscent of Mexican hot chocolate.
            They're best if you err on the side of under-versus over-baking.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon instant espresso powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon strong brewed coffee</li>
        <li> 1 cur all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Topping</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar/li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <p><li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F(175 degrees C). LIne an 8x8
        inch square pan with enough parchment paper to have overhang on all
        sides.</li></p>
        <p><li>Stir espresso powder and coffee together in a small bowl until
        espresso powder is completely dissolved.</li></p>
        <p><li>Whisk flour, cocoa, cream of tartar, baking soda, salt and 1/4
        teaspoon cinnamon together in a bowl; set aside.</li></p>
        <p><li>Beat butter, 1/2 cup white sugar, and brown sugar with an electric 
        mixer together until light and fluffy in  bowl. Beat in espresso mixture,
        egg, and vanilla until well combined. Stir in flour mixture; mix until dough
        just begins to form. Press dough firmly and evenly into the prepared pan using
        lightly floured hands.</li></p>
        <p><li>Whisk 1 tablespoon white sugar and remaining 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
        together in a small bow; sprinkle sugar mixture evenly over the dough.</li></p>
        <p><li>Bake in the preheated oven just until the dough in the center of
        the pan feels barely set, 20 to 23 minutes.</li></p>
        <p><li>Allow cookies to cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Use the
        overhanging parchment to lift cookies out to a wire rack; cool completely
        before cutting into bars.</li></p>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong>You can use hot water in place of brewed black coffee
    to dissolve the espresso powder. You can also add 1/2 cup chocolate chips to
    these, if desired. Simply fold them in before pouring the dough in the pan.</p>
